I will develop a fully compliant PD model from the data they make available,
from the raw data to the level 2 calibration, using what you have learned in the lectures. The

if they were a bank.
You are given information from approximately 50,000 credit cards. The data includes information
from the application to the credit card in Brazil during 2007, some of which can be used to predict
the performance of the loan. The variable description is available in the Excel file
“CC_VariablesList.xls”
